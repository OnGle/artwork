TurnKey Linux Artwork
=====================

Images
------

We've put together `some assets`_ for those times when you want to do
something awesome, such as:

- Using a TKL logo in a blog post or news article about `TurnKey Linux`_
  or the `TurnKey Hub`_.
- Using a TKL logo on your website showing support for the project, or
  if you are a `TKL partner`_.
- Using a TKL logo to advertise your product was built on TurnKey.

Templates
---------

`GIMP templates`_ are available for creating TurnKey appliance logos.

Appliance logos

- Size: 106x111
- Format: PNG (with transparent background)
- Naming convention: ``APPLIANCE/.art/logo.png``
- Each appliance logo should have a unique background color:

  - Duplicate the layer called ``color``, and select it.
  - In the menubar, select ``Colors`` then ``Colorize``.
  - Experiment with different settings for Hue, Saturation and
    Lightness.

When using a company or projects logo, please abide by their terms of
use, guidelines and trademark policy when relevant.

Appliance screenshots
